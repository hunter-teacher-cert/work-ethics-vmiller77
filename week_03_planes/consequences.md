* in 2013 HP was calculating an employee flight risk score (whether or not employees would soonbe leaving the company) and delivering that score to managers. 
* They did this to better understand the reason for attrition and tried to optimize the research process in doing so
* This is unethical because if someone is being mistreated at work and wants to leave, it is unfair that their manager would know this before they share the information with them, as it will give the employee a leg down on negotiations and it would also allow the manager to increase their work load knowing that they were going to leave anyway
