## Topic: Crypto Emissions
* The topic we plan to cover is crypto emissions. We plan to look at the electricity used. Electricity can be generated through coal, natural gases, petroleum, solar, wind and nuclear power. Are all people/organizations mining crypto doing it in a clean way? What about all the waste that comes from graphics cards that people purchase to mine? Is it ethical for people to be buying out these graphics cards, creating a shortage for people who want to use them for recreational gaming use? 
* We plan to incorporate code into our project by creating some type of program that calculates how much electricity one miner uses in a day based off available data (we are aware there are different types of miners and will be specific when discussing this.) We will take the amount of electricity this one miner consumed in X amount of days and calculate how many things could have been powered instead to give people an idea of how much electricity a miner consumes. For example, "You could have powered Y washing machines for Z minutes for the same amount of energy the miner consumed to mine for X minutes"
* This is an ethical concern because crypto mining has become a hot thing to do nowadays. It also comes with personal benefits such as owning crypto currency and producing profits. Some people power their mining rigs with electricity from their homes, others with solar. How much power is really being consumed to power crypto mining and is it worth it? What about the waste and energy that comes from producing miners such as graphic cards? Not to mention companies altering their graphics cards to prevent people from purchasing them to mine with.
